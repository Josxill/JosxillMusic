# Josxill Music

In this repository you can find the music I upload to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@josxill).

I write my music with [Forte 9 Home](https://www.fortenotation.com/). Feel free to download any of my creations - or to play or re-arrange them yourself using the sheet music in this repository. For all of my music you can download the actual sound file, the sheet music and the original Forte file (which makes it easier to e.g., re-arrange the music for your needs).

If not marked otherwise, most of my music can be used for free **as long as you include a reference to my YouTube channel being the original source, in case you use it publicly or commercially**.

## How to Download Files

You can either download individual files or clone the whole repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to always have access to the latest version of all files.

If you have no prior experience in using git (what I expect, if you are just visiting this repository for downloading some music...), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) may be a good choice to simply download new changes with the press of a few buttons.

Therefore, follow this guide to clone the repository **once**:

1. Click `File > Clone repository`
2. Select the `URL` tab
3. Insert the URL of this repository at the top (`https://github.com/Josxill/JosxillMusic`)
4. Insert the desired location on your device at the bottom (e.g., `C:\Users\yourLocalUserName\Desktop\JosxillMusic`)
5. Clone the repository

To then update against the GitHub repository, you just need to press the `Fetch origin` button at the top and (if new changes are available) press the `Pull origin` button afterwards. That way, if you are interested in some of the new music I upload to my channel, you can simply fetch and then pull the new changes to your local instance of my repository, without tediously downloading every single file manually.
