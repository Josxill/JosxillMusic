# Josxill Music

In this repository you can find the music I upload to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@josxill).

I write my music with [Forte 9 Home](https://www.fortenotation.com/). Feel free to download any of my creations - or to play or re-arrange them yourself using the sheet music in this repository. For all of my music you can download the actual sound file, the sheet music and the original Forte file (which makes it easier to e.g., re-arrange the music for your needs).

If not marked otherwise, most of my music can be used for free **as long as you include a reference to my YouTube channel being the original source, in case you use it publicly or commercially**.
